<p>
StudyArabic.com is a free, community driven and supported portal that offers students and teachers
a place to share and exchange information, advice, and resources related to learning
the Arabic language.
</p>

<p>
Arabic is an international language and one of the most spoken in the world. In addition to
being increasingly important due to geopolitical reasons, it is the liturgical language of
over one billion Muslims with an extremely rich literary tradition. Despite all of this, 
students in the West do not have as much of an opportunity to learn Arabic as they do other 
more established but perhaps less widespread and culturally influential languages. This
site is, in a way, a small effort to help remedy this problem.

<div class="subtitle_large margin_bottom">Studying Arabic Abroad</div>
I started this site as way to address a problem I faced as an American college student trying
to choose a place to study Arabic abroad in the summer. As the summer approached,
I spent a sizable amount of time researching various Arabic centers in the Middle East. 
I found plenty of centers with websites claiming to offer top notch classes with the best 
instructors but I had no way to verify with certainty how accurate their claims actually were. 
Thus, the idea of a comprehensive directory of <%= link_to("Arabic centers", centers_path, class: "bold") %> with accurate and up to date 
information and reviews was conceived.
</p>

<p>
In addition to our list of centers and programs, you can also explore our <%= link_to("study abroad forums", category_forum_posts_path(Category.find_by_name("Study Abroad")), class: "bold") %> to
find relevant and up to date information on finding housing, connecting with roommates, and traveling
in the Middle East.

<div class="subtitle_large margin_bottom">Finding Teachers Online</div>
When I finished college, I knew I wanted to keep up with my study of Arabic and naturally,
I looked to the internet as a medium to find a teacher I could skype with to keep my language
skills sharp. After a while, I realized that there were a plethora of websites out there
charging a premium price to find an Arabic tutor or teacher for you. Essentially,
these sites are serving as unnecessary middle men between you and your potential teacher pocketing
most of the money you pay for themselves. I figured, why shouldn't I be able to deal with my online
teacher directly instead of having to go through third party websites? With our database of <%= link_to("Arabic teachers", teacher_profiles_path, class: "bold") %>,
we are attempting to do just that. I wanted to make the process of finding an online teacher
as transparent as possible and what you have with our system is a reliable list of experienced teachers
from all over the world that you can contact directly with no strings attached.
